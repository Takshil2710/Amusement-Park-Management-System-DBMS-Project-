AIM: 
When it comes to Amusement park Management Systems allows you to automate processes from ticketing to waiver management and gives you greater control over operations. Get System and get all park functions geared towards a common goal: delivering delightful guest experiences. 
Analyse attraction popularity to determine future attraction pricing options 
Improve safety of rides by producing a reliable maintenance schedule 
Keeping a detailed record of Staff responsibilities. 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
The database can be used to analyse the business before the summer months to better prepare them for the busiest seasons of the year. 
The general manager has standardized pricing to gauge the true popularity of each attraction before pricing it accordingly for the summer season. 
Maintenance staff will never work on attractions and attraction staff will never work on maintenance tasks. Daily Maintenance tasks will take place at 8:00am every day before opening. 
The park is open from 9:00am-8:30pm. 
Attraction Staff members must work at least 1 shift per day but may work up to 2 shifts a day, and the 2nd shift must be on a different attraction than the first shift worked. 
Attractions do not have to be full for the attraction to run. 
Each Visitor that comes to Adventure Place must purchase at least one ticket through the Ticket Booth. 
 Each Visitor will be asked to supply their Zip Code and Email address. 
 An ID number will be generated for each new visitor & OrderID will hold all of the information pertaining to the one specific attraction transaction. An OrderID must have at least one AttractionID, but can have more. 
 Each Attraction requires the Visitor to have at least one ticket to ride one time.
